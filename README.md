👋 Hi, I’m Jack Gavardari!

I’ve always found that my true happiness, is when i feel this spark inside me come to life.
This is when I’m working on projects I’m really passionate about, it’s also where I do my
best work and thats where I’m most happy. So, what’s important for me is to spend my
time doing meaningful work.

What excites me most to enter the world of Computer Science as a Junior Software Developer
stems from seeking and identifying opportunities that will have the most profound impact.
Having worked closely with many start-ups as a creative, I now want to extend my reach
of tools to fulfil my ambitions and make a profound impact in the teams and company

I hold a wealth of experience applying data analytics to marketing and have played a
leading role in helping entrepreneurs launch their start-ups in the Bristol region.
From designing a global brand, building the foundations for a tech start-up delivery service
to launching a cloud kitchen from the ground-up.

I really take pride in using my creative problem solving skills and expanding my reach of tools
and skill set. I aspire to become a full-stack software engineer in the next 3 years,
I really want to solve problems in society that will have the most profound impact.
